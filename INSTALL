Building Solaris a Solaris Package
----------------------------------

By default, this builds a x86 only package.  To build a full Solaris
package, you will need access to a Solaris AMD64 and Solaris SPARC platform.

On each platform, in the same directory:

$ ./configure --prefix=/opt
$ make clean
$ make package

If you wish to build a sparcv9 package, then uncomment out the sparcv9
lines in solaris/pkg/prototype (or just copy "prototype_sparc" over
"prototype" in solaris/pkg).

Building on Linux and Other
---------------------------

We are currently testing the build on MacOSX and Linux 2.4/2.6.

To compile:

$ ./configure
$ make install
